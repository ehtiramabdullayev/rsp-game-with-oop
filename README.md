# rsp-game-with-oop (IMC)

## Instructions:
  + Make sure we can compile and run your code
  + The purpose of this test is to evaluate your technical skills, design skills and ability to interpret
requirements. 
  + We value simple, readable and maintainable code. 
  + Use of third party libraries is
acceptable, but ensure they add sufficient value.
  + They are open problems and there is no right or wrong answer.

## Problem

Paper-Rock-Scissors is a game for two players. Each player simultaneously opens his/her hand to display
a symbol:
+ Fist equals rock
+ Open hand equals paper
+ Showing the index and middle finger equals scissors.

The winner is determined by the following schema:
+ Paper beats (wraps) rock
+ Rock beats (blunts) scissors
+ Scissors beats (cuts) paper.

Write a program that plays Paper-Rock-Scissors between the computer and a real player. You should be
able to play the game n times before the program exits.

## Requirements 

When starting the assignment, please consider the following advice:

+ Provide a solution as console application and as if it were for a production system. 
+ The solution needs to meet the requirements with simple, clean, understandable and extensible code. 
+ Testing is important to us, so provide good test coverage. 
+ Demonstrate the power of Java, for instance; apply design patterns and use object oriented modeling where appropriate. 
+ If do you decide to use frameworks or libraries, please ensure they add sufficient value and please explain why you chose to use a particular framework or library in a README file.
